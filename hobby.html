                            Quilting
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Jan spends her time with two types of quilting styles, traditional and modern. Traditional uses standard patterns and designs. Modern is like textile art. The fabrics are also different. Traditional fabric is bought pre-colored and patterned at the store rather than dyed at home like with modern styles. When Jan is quilting she is focused and determined on her project. 
                            <p>
                                Here are the steps she takes when quilting. . .

                            <li>Draw it</li>
                            <li>Take pattern to make watercolor image (with watercolors) to get color she wants in pattern</li>
                            <li>Make a multiple watercolor images to see possible variations</li>
                            <li>Dye the fabric to match the colors in the watercolor</li>
                            <li>Wait a couple days for fabric to dry</li>
                            <li>Make pattern of images from the sketches (each color needs its own square of sturdy paper like a blueprint)</li>
                            <li>Enlarge the watercolors by using a printer, sometimes to match the size of the fabric quilt </li>
                            <li>Take each of the shapes that were cut out of different colors and sow them together to match watercolor blueprint </li>

                            Jan loves jazz. Although she doesn't play, she enjoys to listen.
                            When she was in college she took a jazz appreciation which inspired her love for the music.
                            And with that experience she has listened to jazz, gone to jazz concerts for the last 35 years, and got others interested in jazz. Jan listens to a variety of artists but has go-to albums she listens to.
