                        JAN ESTERAICH, Ph.D. received her doctorate in Early Childhood Development and Education in 2018. Her focus of study includes quantitative and qualitative research on young children’s use of technology and mobile media, teachers’ professional development, as well as international approaches for early childhood education, specifically the Reggio Emilia Approach. Research projects during her graduate studies included the evaluation of Save the Children’s Early Steps to School Success home visiting program in rural US communities, the Lincoln Educare Evaluation Team, and a cross-cultural research collaboration of young children’s development of self-regulation with the Hacettepe University in Ankara, Turkey. Graduate assistantship projects included Math Early On – a professional development pilot project to assist teachers in fostering math skills in children ages 0 to 5. Also, Jan authored a comprehensive study of in-service early childhood care providers’ use of technology in their professional development in Nebraska for the Buffett Early Childhood Institute.

                        As a recipient of a Head Start Graduate Student Research Grant, she studied the effects of tablet technology use on self-regulation in Head Start children and as part of the research, introduced new measurement tools for capturing children’s use of tablet technology. Prior to her graduate studies, she was certified to teach early childhood and founded a company that created young children’s emergent literacy software. She also was a production coordinator for Reading Rainbow, a television program created for PBS broadcast.
